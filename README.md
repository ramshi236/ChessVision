▪ The recording of moves during a chess game is often a tedious manual task that impedes the flow of the game, especially in formats such as speed chess where manually recording moves hinders efficient use of time.

▪ In this project we created MATLAB program which record a chess game, identifies pieces and track moves in the game using webcam. 

▪ The procedure divides to three stages: calibration, piece classification and move tracking.

▪ The users can use the program to identify the piece, place them on the board and initialize a game position.

▪ After the position is set the players can start playing, while the program will track the moves and display graphical board on live. 

▪	The software is mainly Matlab based (CV algorithms) with file-based communication to Python that consist the GUI and move\board legality check.
